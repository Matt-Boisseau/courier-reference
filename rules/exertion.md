# Exertion

Exertion measures how worn out the couriers are from pitting their willpower against the world.

It is represented by a number of dice. The facing of these dice indicates their value. That is, they should be rotated such that their value faces up.

## Increasing the Exertion Counter

When increasing exertion, change the value by the number of exertion dice on the table. For example, if there are 3 exertion dice on the table \(no matter their values\), add 3 to the total exertion value.

If there are no exertion dice on the table, add one and set it to 1.

When moving an exertion die past 6, add a new die to the table. Make sure to count the overflow.
