# Triggers

## Influence

When a courier does anything to emotionally or physically influence a person, object, or creature:

* Use the [Willpower ](../reference/animistic-will.md)reference to determine the target's resistance to the particular action.
* Roll dice according to the rules on [Rolling Dice](rolling-dice.md).
* The result of the dice roll represents the couriers' willpower; compare this with the willpower of the target:
  * If greater, the action occurs just as described.
  * If matched, the player who initiated the action must choose one complication.
  * If lesser, the player who initiated the action must choose two complications.
* Increase the [exertion counter](exertion.md).

Complications:

* The desired outcome of the action becomes unattainable for one day.
* One point of reputation is lost with the target or whomever is most affected.
* Every item used by couriers in this action breaks. \(This is not an option if no items were used.\)

## Movement

When moving from one map space to another:

* Reveal any face-down cards on the new location.
* Advance time by one day, triggering [New Day](triggers.md#new-day).
* For each minor arcana on this space, reference [Locations](../reference/locations.md).
* For each major arcana on this space, reference [Leaders](../reference/leaders.md).

Note that this must be done for spaces passed through, as well as the destination.

## New Day

When a day passes, including whenever [Movement ](triggers.md#movement)is triggered:

* Draw one minor arcana per full [exertion die](exertion.md).
* For each minor arcana, reference [Tendencies](../reference/tendencies.md). Any courier who meets the requirements for a tendency must take it.
* Return the [exertion counter](exertion.md) to zero.
* Progress the [Agenda ](agenda.md)by one space.
