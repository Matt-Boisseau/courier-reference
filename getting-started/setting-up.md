# Setting Up

## Supplies

You'll need:

* [ ] 1+ friends
* [ ] 1 tarot deck \(standard 78-card\)
* [ ] 10+ dice \(standard 6-sided kind\)
* [ ] paper & pens
* [ ] a big table that nobody will mind losing for a while

Separate the tarot deck into two draw piles: major and minor arcana.

{% hint style="warning" %}
You will need a large enough space to place a 5x5 grid of tarot cards. Tarot cards are typically quite large, so if you are buying a deck just for _Courier_, I highly recommend a smaller set.

## Placing Cards on the Map

On the standard map below, each `p` represents a polis. The `x` represents the starting point for each game. If you want to deviate from the standard map, consider the gameplay implications of changing the number or positioning of locations.

|  |  |  |  |  |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| p | - | p | - | p |
| - | - | - | - | - |
| p | - | x | - | p |
| - | - | - | - | - |
| p | - | p | - | p |

Draw 8 cards from the major deck. Place one face-down on each polis.

Draw 24 cards from the minor deck. Place one face-down on each empty space.
