# Rules Overview

Playing _Courier_ is simple, as there aren't a lot of rules. There is, however, a lot of content. Each card can mean something different in each context, so you'll need to frequently refer to pages in the Reference section.

## Telling Your Story

There is no Game Master in _Courier_ like there is in many other roleplaying games. Instead, players share the duty of telling their story however they want. There are only a few restrictions:

* Each player has the final say over what their personal courier does.
* Players can't say anything that conflicts with previously established information, including that created by the randomness of the game.
* Certain triggers call for drawing cards, rolling dice, or otherwise moving game pieces. Keep an ear out for these and never skip them.
